# Dash-Texture-Viewer

![DashGL Texture Viewer](https://github.com/kion-dgl/Dash-Texture-Viewer/blob/master/file_formats/fig/step_36.png?raw=true)

A texture viewer for "Megaman Legends" or "Rockman Dash" on the Playstation.
To use the program, hit the dropdown menu in the top left and select "Open".
From there, choose a ".BIN" file from the game disk. The names of all of the
textures in the scene will be displayed in the listbox area on the left.

To preview a texture, click on it. Each texture is comprised of an image body
and a palette. The number of palettes for each texture are displayed as radio
buttons on the right. To cycle through the textures for a given file, click
on each radio button. 

The current texture preview with palette selected can be exported to a PNG file.
With a texture selected, click the dropdown menu in the upper left and select
"Export" from the menu. You will be prompted to select a save location for the
PNG file.

In addition all of the textures for a given scene can be batch exported. With a
".BIN" file loaded, goto the top left dropdown menu and select "Export All".
You will be prompted to select a file location. All of the files in the scene 
will be exported as PNG files, with the name given in the ".BIN" file with
the PNG extension. In this case any files that may share the same name will
be overwritten without being prompted. The author takes no responcibility 
for any loss of data should you do something stupid.

A side note, that while mostly stable, this program has been extensively tested.
There could be compatibility issues with different textures or files or versions
of the game. In addition there could be memory leaks and other problems. 
The purposes of this software are mostly to act as a test and reference for source
code.

### Repository Structure

Some information for file types and data structures in included in the "file_formats"
folder. Command line tools for exporting TIM files from a Rockman Dash ".BIN" file
are included in the "tools" folder if you want to port the functionality to another
language / libary combination.  

The code for the user interface is included in the "src" folder. A number is kept for
each version of the code. So "00", is the eariliest version, "36" or later is the last
version. As this was my first attempt at making a general purpose GTK application I
separated out all of the steps as a reference for how the UI was tested and built.

### Building the Code

Not sure how to build this on Windows or Mac, nor do I intend to release a binary,
as the purpose of this software is more for educational purposes than end-user software.
To compile on Ubuntu / Debian based systems install the dependencies with 

```
$ sudo apt-get install libgtk-3-dev libpng-dev git make
```

And then compile and run with:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kion-dgl/Dash-Texture-Viewer.git
$ cd Dash-Texture-Viewer/src/36
$ make
$ ./a.out
```
